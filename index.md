        <h2 class="mt-0">About Federal Spending Transparency</h2>

        <p>In May 2014, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget led the government wide implementation of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) (P.L. 113-101) under Agile and user centered design. The DATA Act would make federal spending data more accessible, searchable, and reliable. **This historical GitHub website** was used to establish the core data elements of federal spending with user collaboration.</p>

        <p>This space is designed to openly share our <em><strong>process</strong></em> for meeting the data transparency requirements of the DATA Act. Our sister site — <a href="https://usaspending.gov/#/">USAspending.gov</a> — is where you will find the <em><strong>results</strong></em> of this work:  data you can search, view, and download. We invite you - the public - to interact with our site and share your feedback and questions on our <a href="https://onevoicecrm.my.site.com/usaspending/s/"> Community Page</a>!</p>
