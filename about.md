# About

The [Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/2590/text){:target="_blank"} was signed into law on September 26, 2006. The legislation required that federal contract, grant, loan, and other financial assistance awards of more than $25,000 be displayed on a publicly accessible and searchable website to give the American public access to information on how their tax dollars are being spent. In 2008, FFATA was amended by the [Government Funding Transparency Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ282/pdf/PLAW-109publ282.pdf){:target="_blank"}, which required prime recipients to report details on their first-tier sub-recipients for awards made as of October 1, 2010.

The transparency efforts of FFATA were expanded with the enactment of the [Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ101/pdf/PLAW-113publ101.pdf){:target="_blank"} Pub. L. 113-101 on May 9, 2014. The purpose of the DATA Act, as directed by Congress, is to:

* Expand FFATA by disclosing direct agency expenditures and linking federal contract, loan, and grant spending information to federal agency programs;
* Establish government-wide data standards for financial data and provide consistent, reliable, and searchable data that is displayed accurately;
* Simplify reporting, streamline reporting requirements, and reduce compliance costs, while improving transparency;
* Improve the quality of data submitted to [USAspending.gov](http://www.usaspending.gov){:target="_blank"} by holding agencies accountable.


## DATA Act Implementation

#### Agency Implementation

To assist agencies with implementation, OMB and Treasury created a playbook of eight recommendations that, if followed together, help agencies fulfill the requirements of the DATA Act by leveraging existing capabilities and streamlining implementation efforts.
